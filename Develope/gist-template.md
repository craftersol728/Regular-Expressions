# The Amazing Regex

Regular expressions (regex) are a pattern-matching language used for searching, manipulating, and processing text data. They provide a way to match and extract specific patterns from a larger body of text, making them a powerful tool for text processing tasks such as data validation, search-and-replace operations, and information extraction. Regex are used in many programming languages, text editors, and other tools, and are especially useful for working with unstructured text data.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

The regex i will be describing and explain is the following code below:

^([A-Z]{1}[a-z]{1,})\s([A-Z]{1}[a-z]{1,})\s([0-9]{4})\s(\b(?:(?:0?[1-9])|(?:1[0-2]))

The 1st part of this code ^([A-Z]{1}[a-z]{1,}) "^" indicates the start of the string, and the parentheses '()' is a capturing group, and a capturing group in a Regex is it allows me to extract a portion of hte text that matches the pattern inside the parentheses as a seperate value.

So, this part of the regex would match sequences like "John", "Alice", "Michael", etc. and allow you to extract the matched text as a separate value, such as the name of a person.

The 2nd portion of the regex \s([A-Z]{1}[a-z]{1,}) matches a sequence of characters that starts with a white-space character (\s) followed by a capital letter ([A-Z]{1}) and one or more lowercase letters ([a-z]{1,}).

The portion of the regex \s([0-9]{4}) matches a sequence of characters that starts with a white-space character (\s) followed by exactly four digits ([0-9]{4}).As in the previous examples, the parentheses ( ) define a capturing group, which allows you to extract the matched text as a separate value.

The pattern inside the capturing group uses several regular expression features, such as a non-capturing group (?:), an alternation (|), and an optional match (?).

The first alternative (?:0?[1-9]) matches an optional zero (0?) followed by a digit in the range 1 to 9. The second alternative (?:1[0-2]) matches a digit 1 followed by a digit in the range 0 to 2. The non-capturing group (?: ) is used to group the alternatives and make the alternation (|) apply to the whole group.

An example of a string that would match this regex is "John Doe 2022 12", where:

    The first capturing group ([A-Z]{1}[a-z]{1,}) matches "John"
    The second capturing group ([A-Z]{1}[a-z]{1,}) matches "Doe"
    The third capturing group ([0-9]{4}) matches "2022"
    The fourth capturing group (\b(?:(?:0?[1-9])|(?:1[0-2]))) matches "12"
    
So, the matched string represents the name, surname, year, and month respectively. The matched values could be used for further processing or manipulation.
